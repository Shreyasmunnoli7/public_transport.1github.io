🛠 Projects

Public Transport Optimization

OVERVIEW:
To develop a Smart City, we are addressing key challenges such as public transportation optimization, connectivity enhancement, and seamless passenger experiences. By improving route efficiency and service reliability, we aim to reduce commute times, lower emissions, and make public transport the preferred choice for urban travel. This solution integrates technology to create a sustainable, accessible, and user-friendly transportation system.

Technical Stack:
Languages: C++, Java
Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, A*, KMP, Chain Hashing, Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)
Tools: Graphs, DAA Optimization Techniques

Impact:

1. Efficient Commute:
Optimized routes and schedules improve travel time and reduce congestion.


2. Reduced Carbon Footprint:
Promotes the use of eco-friendly modes of transportation, contributing to a greener environment.


3. Cost Savings:
Reduces transportation costs for residents and the city through resource-efficient systems.


4. Accessibility:
Ensures reliable transport options for all, including underserved communities.


5. Economic Growth:
Enhances connectivity for businesses and communities, driving local economic activity.
